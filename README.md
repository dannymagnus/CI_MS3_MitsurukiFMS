#### Overview

The Mitsuruki FMS (Fleet Management System) is for the management of a collection of vehicles within the Mitsuruki car product engineering and testing team.  It's purpose is to provide an easy way for drivers to provide vehicle assessments for the engineering team to review prior to investigation of any reported issues.  This is to better develop our products before releasing them to market.

#### Main Menu

On the main menu, you will be provdided with 2 options.

Operation: Input numeric value and press enter key.

1: The vehicle menu - this contains all of the vehicles that are held for test by the engineering fleet.  The purpose of this sub menu structure is for users to be able to interogate a particular registration for feature fitments (eg. heated seats), should that be required for a particular testing usecase.

It is also for fleet owners to be able to add and remove vehicles from the database once they are de-fleeted or replaced.

2: The appraisal menu option.  This directs users to a submenu where users can submit results of a vehicle assesment and engineers can review them.

#### Vehicle Menu

Purpose: To allow users to search a vehicle by registration, add or remove a vehicle to or from the catalogue.

Operation: Input numeric value and press enter key

1: Search the vehicle by registration.

Enter Vehicle Registration: Enter a valid registration (eg VE70EKU).  Registration is not case sensitive but should be of the correct length and format.  Validation exists to prompt for errors in length, but format needs to be the diligence of the user.

2: Add vehicle: Enter details as prompted on screen 

- Enter Vehicle Registration: Enter a valid registration (eg VE70EKU).  Registration is not case sensitive but should be of the correct length and format.  Validation exists to prompt for errors in length, but format needs to be the diligence of the user.

- Enter Model: Valid model types are Slicker, Slider, Trojan, ETronic.

- Enter Colour: There are no pre-determined colour types.  Please be mindful that the colour is correct as per the manufacturer datasheet (not included here) as this maybe a search function later in time.

- Heated (y/n):  Enter using y or n only.  This option is to indicate whether heated seats are fitted or not.

- Massage (y/n): Enter using y or n only. This option is to indicate whether massage seats are fitted.  For ETronic models this option is not available.

- Confirmation of addition to database (y/n): Confirm whether to be upload to the fleet catalogue.  Confirmation will be displayed if upload is successful.

3: Remove vehicle: Enter details as prompted on screen.

- Enter Vehicle Registration: Enter a valid registration (eg VE70EKU).  Registration is not case sensitive but should be of the correct length and format.  Validation exists to prompt for errors in length, but format needs to be the diligence of the user.

- Vehicle catalogue will be searched. If such a registration exists, then a confirmation prompt will follow.

-Confirmation (y/n): Confirmation to remove from catalogue.  IMPORTANT! This action is detructive and cannot be reversed.  Please be sure this is the desired action.

4: Return to main menu: Returns user to main menu.

#### Appraisal Menu

1: Add appraisal: Enter details as promped on screen.

- Enter Vehicle Registration: Enter a valid registration (eg VE70EKU).  Registration is not case sensitive but should be of the correct length and format.  Validation exists to prompt for errors in length, but format needs to be the diligence of the user.

- Enter date of appraisal: This should be the date that the appraisal took place.  Correct format should be dd/mm/yy.

- Enter appraisal details: This should be as descriptive as possible of the issues witnessed.  Please reference symptoms only, and do not assume root cause.  e.g. No navigation maps displayed in main instrument panel, rather than navigation didn't work or navigation crashed.  Please include the time stamp of the issue e.g.(1523).

- Confirmation of upload: Confirm using (y or n) to upload appraisal to the database.

2: Search appraisal: Enter details as prompted on screen.

- Enter Vehicle Registration: Enter a valid registration (eg VE70EKU).  Registration is not case sensitive but should be of the correct length and format.  Validation exists to prompt for errors in length, but format needs to be the diligence of the user.

- Confirmation: if the vehicle exists, then a confirmation will be presented.  Pressing enter will display all appraisals for that vehicle.

3: Main Menu: This returns the user to the main menu.

## Technical Design

### Flow Chart

Below you can see the flowchart, created with [diagrammes.io](www.diagrammes.io)

<details><summary>Flowchart</summary>
<img src="docs/flowcharts/flowchartfms.png"></details>

### Data models

For this project I have used largely lists, dictionaries and 4 classes for the vehicle lines themselves.
- Classes - I have used 5 classes. One parent class of car, from which the subsequent classes inherit base values and 4 subclasses for each of the vehicle models; Slicker, Slider, ETronic and Trojan.   Each have some similar attibutes which are determined by the user and some unique attributes eg type (estate, pickup etc).
- Google sheets API.  I have chosen to use Google Sheets API so that the required data for the app will persist outside of the container.
- As the programme is working closely with Google Sheets, I have used lists and dictionaries.  List to work with adding data to the google sheet and dictionaries to search for objects within the sheets.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)

### Frameworks and Tools

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git was used for version control within VSCode to push the code to GitHub.
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/) - GitHub was used as a remote repository to store project code. 
3. [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
VSCode was the IDE used to write the remainder of the project code.
4. [Diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) - was used to draw flowchart.
5. [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/) - was used to store data outside of the program.  The vehicle catalogue and appraisal data stored in 2 separate sheets.
6. [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console/) - was used to manage access and permissions to the google services, google auth, sheets etc.

#### Libraries

1. datetime - for date format validation and ensuring user input is not in the future.
2. gspread - used to manipulate google sheets from the python client.

## Features

### Main Menu

The main menu gives a paragraph welcome and introduction to the Fleet Management System.  It presents the user with 2 options for the Vehicle Catalogue and the Appraisal Menu respectively.

This give the user the function of searching the fleet database by registration to return the full vehicle description including any special fitment such as heated or massage seats, so the user can assess the vehicle before booking for an appraisal.  This can also be used by engineers to find the spec of the vehicle after an appraisal.  This function will search vehicles on record and return an error if no such vehicle exists.  It will also validate data entry to a degree (eg. Reg length etc).  It does rely to a degree that the user is in earnest trying to complete entry successfully.  Once located, a prompt will be given to ask if the user wishes to display the data.
